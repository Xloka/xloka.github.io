#Hello World Post

Welcome to my blog as You know I am a Developer so everything in my life should start with **Hello World** . it's one of my beloved habits and I'm willing to keep it ;)


### Why ?
Not so good reasons but they made me make it :

* I love to express myself where no one have the interest to read but the very few who really want to .
* Escaping from the noise of social media.
* it's a dream , to write my thoughts in my text editor and publish them using my terminal.WOW.
* I love github and I want to be related to it's era ;)


### Subscribe
I will post every day if I could , sharing something I learned or something I enjoyed working at

thanks for reaching to this point , leave a comment or go make something amazing :P
